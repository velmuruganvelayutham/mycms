<p>This is a simple menu system designed to work in Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Opera.
This does however lead to some limitations and I'm going to cover some these and see what
can be done and how. If you are not interested in these you can go directly to the
<a href="xmenu2.html">implementation description</a>.</p>

<h2>Static Content Model</h2>

<p>Opera has a serious limitation when it comes to DHTML and that is that you cannot change
the content at runtime. This means that you cannot add or remove nodes. It also means that
you cannot modify a text node (no way to change the text). This means that we cannot add
and remove menus at runtime. Everything needs to be created at load, therefore we use the
old classical <code>document.write</code> to generate our content.</p>

<h2>Element Boundaries</h2>

<p>To get the element size in IE, Mozilla and Opera we use the MS proprietary properties called
<code>offsetWidth</code> and <code>offsetHeight</code>. Even though IE before version 6 uses a
non standard box model all three browsers return the border box size when using
<code>offsetWidth</code> and <code>offsetHeight</code>. This means that the size includes paddings
and borders.<p>

<h2>Element Positions</h2>

<p>Once again all browsers use the same properties but this time it is not equally easy since
all of them treat them a little bit different. The properties to use here are
<code>offsetLeft</code>, <code>offsetTop</code> and <code>offsetParent</code>. The difference is
basically that Opera returns the position from the offsetParent's top left corner while IE
and Mozilla returns the position from the upper left minus the borders. Another problem that is
ignored when finding the positions for the XMenu is that any container may have been scrolled. If
you want to take this into account you need to subtract the <code>scrollLeft</code> and
<code>scrollTop</code>.

<h2>Window Size</h2>

<p>All three browser do allow you to get the size of the document. Opera and Mozilla use
<code>window.innerWidth</code> and <code>window.innerHeight</code> just like Netscape
Navigator 4.x. In IE on the other hand we return the size of the root (canvas) element. This is
normally the <code>html</code> element but if IE is in quirks mode (all versions prior to IE6
except IE5 Mac) this is the <code>body</code>.</p>

<h2>Event Model</h2>

<p>Only Mozilla supports the W3C standard way of hooking up events correctly but all three
browsers almost support the event attributes on html identically. The big difference
is that IE incorrectly binds the <code>event</code> object to the <code>window</code> object.
The menu system does not need the event object because all elements pass all the desired
arguments in the event attributes.</p>

<pre>
&lt;a href="myuri" onmouseover="webFXMenuHandler.overMenuItem(this)"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Box Model</h2>

<p>This is the biggest problem today when trying to create cross browser DHTML applications because
Internet Explorer (before version 6) does not support the correct box model. CSS3 has a proposed
property called <code>box-sizing</code> which currently have two possible values,
<code>border-box</code> and <code>content-box</code>. Border box is what old versions of IE are using
and content box is what CSS1 uses. Border box means that the width is calculated including the border
and padding. Content box does not include the borders nor the padding. This gives Mozilla and Opera a
wider box and therefore som extra properties are needed to make the layout identical in the different
browsers.</p>

<p>There is a trick that can be used when defining the CSS for cross browser applications.
IE5 added a proprietary value called <code>expression</code> which evaluates an expression
and uses that value as the value for the property. All browsers with correct CSS support
should ignore invalid CSS declarations so declarations done using expression are ignored.
The following CSS declarations give the same look and feel in all three browsers.</p>

<pre>
.selector {
   border:  10px solid black;
   padding: 10px;
   width:   60px;
   width:   expression(ieBox ? 100 : 60 + "px");
}
</pre>

<h3>Opera Focus Bug</h3>

<p>The menu system uses the events <code>onfocus</code> and <code>onfocus</code> to show
and hide the menus. This allows an easy way to make sure the menus are hidden with almost
no code.</p>

<p>Opera does however not support focus on anchors so to get the menus to work in Opera
the hover mode is used.</p>
