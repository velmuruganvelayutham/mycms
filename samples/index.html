<p>Welcome to MeshCMS. This is a sample home page that you can easily edit after 
  you have logged in.</p>
<p>Here is a list of tasks you can try to test this CMS:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 
    <p>click on <em>Login</em> and insert username <em><strong>admin</strong></em> 
      and password <em><strong>admin</strong></em>;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>when you see the <em>Control Panel</em>, click on <em>Site Home</em> to 
      go back to this page, then click on <em>Edit this page</em> to open the 
      WYSIWYG editor;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>experiment with the editor and then save the page;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>go to the <em>Page Manager</em> in the <em>Control Panel</em> and create 
      a new page under the home page, then edit it;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>go back to the <em>Page Manager</em> and try changing themes (pages whose 
      theme field is empty will inherit the theme from the parent)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>You need to allow popups from the site where MeshCMS is running, otherwise 
  you won&#39;t be able to use the file browser to choose links and images while 
  editing pages.</p>
<p>A demo module is provided. If you want to write your own modules, you can <a href="module_examples/includeastext/">look 
  at the source code</a> to start learning how to create them.</p>
